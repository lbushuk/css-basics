        "In exchange, for Indigenous lands, the federal government agreed to set
        up certain areas as "reserves" (i.e. protected from encroachment by
        white settlers). These lands no longer belong to the Indigenous peoples
        despite them living on it. The lands on which the Indigenous peoples
        lived, can be taken or sold by the government, but only with the consent
        of the natives peoples, or with compensation. In addition, the
        government promised to open schools for Indigenous children. Each
        reserve was to receive a school house, which would be built by the
        government. The idea of giving the Indigenous peoples an education was
        an attempt to help them become more successful in terms of communication
        with the settlers. It was also an attempt to help the Indigenous
        community understand how the Europeans lived, and to use their ways of
        living to help the Indigenous population thrive. However, education was
        optional on reserves for the beginning of the treaty. The federal
        government offered education if the Indigenous peoples should desire it,
        but it was not mandatory. Nevertheless, not long after the treaty was
        signed, Indigenous children were being forced to attend school despite
        the treaty stating that it was optional for children to attend. The sale
        of alcohol was also restricted on reserves.
      </p>

        The terms of Treaty 6 gave every family of five living on the reserve
        one square mile. Smaller families received land according to the size of
        their family. Each person immediately received CA$12 and an additional
        $5 a year. A maximum of four chiefs and other officers per band would
        receive $15 each and a salary of $25 per year plus one horse, one
        harness, and one wagon or two carts. The Indigenous peoples also
        received a $1500 grant every year to spend on ammunition and twine in
        order to make fish nets. As well, each family was to be given an entire
        suite of agricultural tools including spades, harrows, scythes,
        whetstones, hay forks, reaping hooks, ploughs, axes, hoes, and several
        bags of seed. They were also to acquire a cross-cut saw, a hand saw, and
        a pit-saw, files, a grindstone, an auger, and a trunk of carpenter's
        tools. Additionally, they were to receive wheat, barley, potatoes, oats,
        as well as four oxen, a bull, six cows, two sows, and a hand-mill. These
        were all included in Treaty 6 so that the Indigenous peoples would use
        these tools to create a living for themselves." -
