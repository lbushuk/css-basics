          km<sup>2</sup>) per family of five.
          <ul>

      <h2>Medicine Chest</h2>
      <p>
        "One of the selling points of the treaty was that a medicine chest would
        be kept at the home of the Indian agent for use by the people. The
        "medicine chest clause" has been interpreted by native leaders to mean
        that the federal government has an obligation to provide all forms of
        healthcare to First Nations people on an ongoing basis. In particular,
        the Assembly of First Nations considers the funding of the Non-Insured
        Health Benefits program as one aspect of this responsibility."

      <h2>Miscommunication</h2>
      <p>
        The Government of Canada believes the terms of the treaty were written
        down clearly within the document, but in the oral traditions of the
        Indigenous peoples, they have a different understanding of the treaty
        terms. Although there were three interpreters presents at the
        negotiations for Treaty 6, two from the Crown and one from the
        Indigenous peoples, direct translation of words between English and Cree
        was not possible. Certain words in either language did not have a
        corresponding word in the opposite language. This meant that both groups
        did not understand each other fully as the concepts were changed due to
        the word changes between the languages. The Indigenous peoples had to
        especially rely on their interpreter because the document they were to
        sign was solely in English, giving them the disadvantage as the
        interpreter had to explain the words, meanings and concepts of the
        treaty text because the Cree could not speak or read English. The
        Indigenous peoples claim they accepted Treaty 6 because they were
        informed that the Crown did not want to buy their land, but instead
        borrow it. Another understanding was that the Indigenous peoples could
        choose the amount of land they wanted to retain, but surveyors came to
        set per person perimeters on the reserves which was seen as a violation
        of the treaty. Indigenous peoples thought the treaty would adapt due to
        the changing conditions such as the amount of currency, the drastic
        change in health services, and the more efficient agricultural tools
        which have been invented or modified to better suit the conditions of
        farming. However, the treaty terms have remained the same which have
        caused Indigenous peoples to believe the treaty terms should be
        re-evaluated to better suit the needs of Indigenous people today.
