      <h2>In exchange for the land of the First Nations, Treaty 6 provided:</h2>

      <ul id="center-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Reserve lands</strong> of one mile<sup>2</sup> (about 2.5
          km<sup>2</sup>) per family of five.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Indigenous peoples retained the right to pursue hunting, trapping
              and fishing on reserve lands.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The establishment of <strong>schools</strong> <em>on</em> reserves
        </li>
        <li>A <strong>medicine</strong> chest on each reserve</li>
        <li><strong>Assistance</strong> in times of famine</li>
        <li>
          The following <strong>payments</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>An annual cash payment of $25 per chief</li>
            <li>$15 per headman and $5 for all other band members</li>
            <li>A one-time cash payment of $12 for each band member</li>
            <li>
              $1,000 for Indigenous peoples farming on reserves, for the first
              three years after the treaties signing
            </li>

      <h2>Medicine Chest</h2>
      <p>
        One of the selling points of the treaty was that a medicine chest would
        be kept at the home of the Indian agent for use by the people. The
        "medicine chest clause" has been interpreted by native leaders to mean
        that the federal government has an obligation to provide all forms of
        healthcare to First Nations people on an ongoing basis. In particular,
        the Assembly of First Nations considers the funding of the Non-Insured
        Health Benefits program as one aspect of this responsibility.
