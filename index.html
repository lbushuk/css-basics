        <p>
          A treaty is a formal agreement between two or more parties. The thing
          about treaties is that they are binding; treaties last forever.

          numbered treaties. It was signed in 1876 by representatives of the
          Crown and Cree, Ojibwe, and Assiniboine leaders. It extends from the
          mid section of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and includes a couple of
          communities in Manitoba.
