      <p>
        Treaty 6 is one of the 11 Canadian numbered treaties. It was signed in
        1876 by representatives of the Crown and Cree, Ojibwe, and Assiniboine
        leaders. It extends from the mid section of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
        and includes a couple of communities in Manitoba. This treaty extends on
        terms present in treaties 1 through 5, with the addition of protection
        from famine, and medicial supplies
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Treaty?</h2>
      <p>
        A treaty is simply an agreement between two or more parties. The
        difference with treaties is that they are binding; treaties last
        forever.
