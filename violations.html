        <h2>The Dominion of Canada</h2>
        <p>
          The Dominion Government violated many of the treaty terms; in
          restructuring and mandating education through the creation of
          residential schools, the government breached the treaty agreements
          around the question of education. Many First Nations were allocated
          less reserve lands than they were supposed to according to the Treaty,
          which resulted in many indigenous land claims based on treaty rights
          entitlements. Also, First Nations felt the agreements from the
          numbered treaties were dishonoured when their traditional forms of
          governance were removed and they became "wards of the state", and when
          Indian agents began to control the sale of their seeds and livestock.
          Further restrictions and policies were put in place that controlled
          First Nations' way of life beyond the original stipulations that were
          outlined in the numbered treaties.

        <h2>Residential Schools</h2>
        <p>
          In Canada, the Indian residential school system was a network of
          boarding schools for Indigenous peoples. The network was funded by the
          Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs and administered by
          Christian churches. The school system was created to isolate
          Indigenous children from the influence of their own native culture and
          religion in order to assimilate them into the dominant Canadian
          culture. Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year
          existence, around 150,000 children were placed in residential schools
          nationally. By the 1930s, about 30 percent of Indigenous children were
          attending residential schools. The number of school-related deaths
          remains unknown due to incomplete records. Estimates range from 3,200
          to over 30,000, mostly from disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The residential school system harmed Indigenous children significantly
          by removing them from their families, depriving them of their
          ancestral languages, and exposing many of them to physical and sexual
          abuse. Conditions in the schools led to student malnutrition,
          starvation, and disease. Students were also subjected to forced
          enfranchisement as "assimilated" citizens that removed their legal
          identity as Indians. Disconnected from their families and culture and
          forced to speak English or French, students often graduated being
          unable to fit into their communities but remaining subject to racist
          attitudes in mainstream Canadian society. The system ultimately proved
          successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and
          beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system has been linked
          to an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism,
          substance abuse, suicide, and intergenerational trauma which persist
          within Indigenous communities today.
